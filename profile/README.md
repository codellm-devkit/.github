Codellm-Devkit (CLDK) is a multilingual program analysis framework that bridges the gap between traditional static analysis tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized for code (CodeLLMs). Codellm-Devkit allows developers to streamline the process of transforming raw code into actionable insights by providing a unified interface for integrating outputs from various analysis tools and preparing them for effective use by CodeLLMs.

## Getting Started

- ðŸ“š Read the [Documentation](https://codellm-devkit.github.io/docs) for guides and tutorials
- ðŸ’» Use our SDKs to start building:
  - [Python SDK](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/python-sdk)
  - [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/typescript-sdk)
- ðŸ¤– CLDK wrappers for [Tool Calling](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/cldk-tool-calling) with various LLMs.
- âœ¨ CLDK usage [examples](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/cldk-examples)

## Software Development Kits (SDKs)

- [python-sdk](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/python-sdk) - Python implementation
- [typescript-sdk](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/typescript-sdk) - TypeScript implementation

## Language Specific Analysis Backends
- [codeanalyzer-java](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/codeanalyzer-java) - Uses WALA and Java Parser to provide static analysis artifacts for Java and JavaEE projects.
- [codeanalyzer-rs](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/codeanalyzer-rs) - Provides static analysis artifacts for Rust projects.

## CodeLLM usage plugins  
- [cldk-tool-calling](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/cldk-tool-calling) - Wrappers for various tool calling with LLMs

## Documentation and Examples
- [docs](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/docs) - User documentation and guides
- [cldk-examples](https://github.com/codellm-devkit/cldk-examples) - several usage examples with CLDK
